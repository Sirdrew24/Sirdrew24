- 👋 Hi, I’m @Sirdrew24
- 👀 I’m interested in programming back end development and games
- 🌱 I’m currently learning how to create Minecraft mods
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on anything that might be gaming related. I have not collaborated with anyone on programming projects before so I think that it would be fun.
- 📫 How to reach me: Discord: Sirdrew24 #7213
